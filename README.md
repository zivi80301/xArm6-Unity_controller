# xArm6-Unity_controller
The Unity project used to control the xArm6 with ROS @ HRL

The other half of this project can be found here:

Download everything in a .zip file. Create a new folder which will be your project folder and unzip the contents you just downloaded into it. Unity typicalle creates projects under c:\users\\\<your username>, 
so I would recommend you create a your project folder in the same place.
Then open the unity hub, click open and select the project folder. You can then download an appropriate version of Unity (2021.3.xx should work). Once everything is in place, you can click on the project inside 
Unity Hub to open it.
